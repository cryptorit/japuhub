open source community project from IRL to Web3

"Casa Japuanga is an intentional urban community formed by residents and collaborators, which for over a decade has been organizing interdisciplinary events involving art, gastronomy, and education for the community within the house space. Currently, the house has six permanent residents and an extended community with over 50 collaborators actively engaged with the house, along with a broad network of attendees formed over the years of the project.

Casa Japuanga sees itself as an Autonomous Cultural Territory, with a decentralized management structured organically from the encounter between the residents' skills and the extended community. It is also part of the Oceano Cultural network, connecting over 150 autonomous cultural spaces in SÃ£o Paulo - BR.

The community's interest in Web3 technology lies in the possibilities of developing decentralized governance that can enhance existing processes, fostering greater community engagement and aiming for sustainability within the principles of the creative economy.

Our first and biggest challenge is to educate the community about Web3, and our chosen path is to hold 4 interdisciplinary events involving art, technology, and community processes within the house space, attracting artists, enthusiasts, and the community for an emotionally engaging onboarding process."
